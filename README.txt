2D Rigid Body Simulator
Edward Wang, originally for CS 348C at Stanford (fall 2016).

Much of initial code adapted from Java starter package from Doug James' CS 5643 class assignment [1].
[Still buggy] iterative constraint solver method from the implementation described in Kenny Erleben's 2007 on shock propagation [2].
SAT solving technique for collision detection based off of Metanet tutorials [3].
